      <h1>Yeast Dataset</h1>
        <p>The Yeast dataset represents a biological network of protein interactions in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It captures physical interactions between proteins that are involved in various biological processes within the organism. The dataset was extracted from a comprehensive study on yeast protein interactions, which are crucial for understanding cellular functions, protein complex formation, and cellular processes. The dataset includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1458 proteins (nodes) that represent individual protein entities within the yeast cell.</li>
        <li>1948 interactions (edges) representing physical interactions between pairs of proteins.</li>
        <li>Each interaction is undirected, meaning that the relationship between two proteins is symmetric.</li>
      </ul>
