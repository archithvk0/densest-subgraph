      <h1>Core Exact Algorithm</h1>
      
      <p>Algorithm-4, referred to as the CORE-EXACT method, is an optimized version of the exact densest subgraph discovery approach.
It builds upon Algorithm-1 (EXACT) by integrating k-core decomposition to pre-process the graph, thereby reducing its size and complexity before applying the binary search and max-flow based method.
 Key features are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>K-core Pruning: Before performing binary search, a k-core decomposition is computed. Vertices with low degree are pruned early, significantly reducing the graph size and the number of flow computations.
</li>
  <li>Accelerated Binary Search: After pruning, the densest subgraph is found by performing binary search over candidate densities on the reduced graph.
</li>
  <li>Flow Network Construction: Similar to Algorithm-1, flow networks are constructed for each density guess, and maximum flow is used to validate the existence of subgraphs exceeding the guessed density.
</li>
  <li>Efficiency Boost: By working on a smaller graph, CORE-EXACT achieves faster running times while still guaranteeing exact correctness.
</li>
  
</ul>
